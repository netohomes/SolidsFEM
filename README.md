# SolidsFEM
FEM code to solve the equilibrium equations over a static solid.

Input is created using the GID software and also the output is written in GID format.

This code was done a time ago (around 2015) so GID may have had change the input and output format. You may need to check it.

When the problem is solved over a solid you will be able to see forces, displacements and the stresses over the mesh nodes.
